# This script is being called by a Bamboo Job. It increments the minor version of the global Bamboo variable

# Bamboo Plan Variables:
#  ManualBuildTriggerReason_userName - the login name of the current user
#  atlassianPassword - the Atlassian password of the current user
#  reviewer - the reviewer for the pull request

# treat unset variables as an error when substituting
