# This script is being called by the Bamboo Job https://ci.gerdi-project.de/browse/UTIL-MHVU
# It attempts to find the last successful build of the plan https://ci.gerdi-project.de/browse/UTIL-UHV that creates a JIRA ticket
# with associated branches and pull requests for updating Maven Parent versions of Harvester projects.
# This script attempts to merge all approved pull requests of said JIRA ticket and removes the feature branches afterwards.
# If all branches were merged, the JIRA ticket is set to DONE.
#
# Bamboo Plan Variables:
#  ManualBuildTriggerReason_userName - the login name of the current user
#  atlassianPassword - the Atlassian password of the current user
#  jiraIssueKey - the key of the JIRA ticket that is to be merged. If left blank, the ticket key 
#                 will be retrieved from the last https://ci.gerdi-project.de/browse/UTIL-UHV build
