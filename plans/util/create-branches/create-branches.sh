# This script is called by a Bamboo Job. It iterates a list of projects and/or git clone links and creates

#
# Bamboo Plan Variables:
#  ManualBuildTriggerReason_userName - the login name of the current user
#  atlassianPassword - the Atlassian password of the current user
#  projectsAndCloneLinks - a comma separated list of project abbreviations and clone links for which branches are to be created
#  createdBranchName - the name of the branch that is to be created
#  sourceBranchName - the name of the source branch from which the branch is to be created

# treat unset variables as an error when substituting
