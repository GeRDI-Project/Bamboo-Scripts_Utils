# This script is called by Bamboo Deployment Jobs.
# It deploys a service defined by a YAML file to the Kubernetes cluster.
# The prerequisite for this script to work is that the create-k8s-yaml script was executed
# before the execution of this script.
#
# Arguments: -
#
# Bamboo Plan Variables:
#  bamboo_planRepository_1_repositoryUrl 
#    The ssh clone link to the first repository of the plan.


# treat unset variables as an error when substituting
set -u

# define global variables
KUBERNETES_YAML_DIR="gerdireleases"
